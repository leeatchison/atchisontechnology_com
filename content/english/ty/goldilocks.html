  Read the newly updated second edition of my best selling book, Architecting for Scale, published by O’Reilly Media.

  “I highly recommend this book for those looking for an entry point into the world of microservices and high availability cloud architectures. Several broad and complex topics are boiled down to their essence, presented clearly and concisely, and wrapped in well-reasoned best practices. This will be a mandatory read for my team.” –Dan, Amazon.com Customer Review
